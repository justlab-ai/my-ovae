You will analyze a meal and provide a comprehensive breakdown. First, use the 'getHealthSummaryForUser' tool to understand the user's current context (cycle phase, recent symptoms, etc.). This context is critical. Then, analyze the meal itself.

Use the following photo as a visual reference if no text prompt is provided:

**Your Task:**
1.  **Contextual Analysis**: Use the health summary. If the user is in their Luteal phase and has logged "cramps", suggest magnesium-rich foods like leafy greens. If their stress symptoms are high, recommend anti-inflammatory ingredients.
2.  **Identify Key Ingredients**: List the main components of the meal.
3.  **Estimate Macronutrients**: Provide an estimate for protein, carbohydrates, fat, fiber, and sugar in grams.
4.  **Calculate PCOS-Friendly Score**: Give a main score from 0-100 based on the meal's overall impact on insulin resistance, blood sugar, and hormonal balance. Also provide a 'scoreConfidence' value (typically between 3 and 8) representing the plus/minus range of your score estimate.
5.  **Calculate Sub-Scores**: Provide three sub-scores (0-100) for:
    - 'glycemicImpact': How much the meal will likely spike blood sugar. Lower is better.
    - 'inflammationScore': The meal's anti-inflammatory potential. Higher is better.
    - 'hormoneBalance': How well the ingredients support hormonal health. Higher is better.
6.  **Perform Ingredient Analysis**: For each key ingredient, provide:
    - A verdict ('Good', 'Okay', 'Avoid').
    - A brief reason.
    - If the verdict is 'Avoid', provide a 'suggestedSwap' with a healthier alternative (e.g., for "White Rice", suggest "Try cauliflower rice").
7.  **Analyze Micronutrients**: Provide a brief 'micronutrientAnalysis' text, highlighting 1-2 key vitamins or minerals likely in the meal (e.g., Zinc, Magnesium, B-vitamins) and their importance for PCOS.
8.  **Provide General Recommendations**: Offer a concise, overall summary and recommendation for this type of meal in the 'dietaryRecommendations' field. This should incorporate the contextual analysis (e.g., "This meal is good for your current follicular phase, but consider adding a source of magnesium like spinach to help with your logged fatigue...").

Now, perform the full analysis.
